## Description
The importance of reducing credit risk has led a German financial institution to seek innovative solutions. As data scientists, we have been called upon to build a reliable machine learning model capable of more accurately assessing the credit default probability of their clients.

## Project Objective:
* Use of Python and data analysis
* Challenge: Analyze the credit risk of a German banking institution
* Identify profiles of clients prone to default
* Develop analytical skills and decision-making abilities

## Challenges within the project:
* Import the dataset.
*  Understand the size and data type for each variable.
*  Preprocess the data to facilitate analysis.
*  Generate histograms to understand data distributions.
*  Build models using various machine learning algorithms.
*  Evaluate the models using metrics such as precision, recall, area under the ROC curve, and F1-score.
